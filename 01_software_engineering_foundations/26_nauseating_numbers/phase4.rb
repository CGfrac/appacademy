# A "Mersenne prime" is a prime number that is one less than a power of 2. 
# This means that it is a prime number with the form 2^x - 1, where x is some exponent. 
# For example:

#     3 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 3 = 2^2 - 1
#     7 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 7 = 2^3 - 1
#     11 is not a Mersenne prime because although it is prime, it does not have the form 2^x - 1

# The first three Mersenne primes are 3, 7, and 31.
# Write a method mersenne_prime that accepts a number, n, as an argument and returns the n-th Mersenne prime.
